[Employee Scheduling](https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/employee_scheduling)

> Organizations whose employees work multiple shifts need to schedule sufficient workers for each daily shift. Typically, the schedules will have constraints, such as "no employee should work two shifts in a row". Finding a schedule that satisfies all constraints can be computationally difficult.

> The following sections present two examples of employee scheduling problems, and show how to solve them using the CP-SAT solver.

> The CP solver was developed 10 years ago.
> 3-4 years ago, we started the SAT/CP solver.  Its performances are way better than the CP one.

> If you want to constrain the length of a sequence, you should look at the shift_scheduling example

> In particular, the soft sequence constraint. The idea is the following, for every starting point, you want to forbid 010, 0110, 01110, ..., 0111110 and 01111111111110 (0110 means work[start] is false, work[start + 1] is true, work[start + 2] is true, work[start + 3] is false.

[CP-SAT Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver)

> To increase computational speed, the CP-SAT solver works over the integers. This means you must define your optimization problem using integers only.

> let's start with a simple example problem in which there are:

> Three variables, x, y, and z, each of which can take on the values: 0, 1, or 2.
One constraint: x â‰  y

> Fairness is the most complex question in OR. You need to try to capture what you want with equations as sample as possible.

> Std deviation, variance are not simple. Minimizing max(worked per person) - min(worked per person);is simple.
